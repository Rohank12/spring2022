1. (**Priority**) Work with a partner to add "advice to future students" testimonials to [website for this offering](https://introcompsys.github.io/spring2022) and "why take this class" testimonials to the [main course site](https://introcompsys.github.io/) using an integration manager like workflow. Coordinate to determine who's fork will be used for integration of each  . Each of you should clone that fork and add your contribution to [`resources/testimonials.md`](https://github.com/introcompsys/spring2022/blob/main/resources/testimonials.md) and [`fromstudents.md`](https://github.com/introcompsys/introcompsys.github.io/blob/main/fromstudents.md) on a branch, `<initials>_testimonial` eg Professor Brown's would be `smb_testimnial`. Then merge the two contributions to a single `testimonial` branch.  (both to help future students *and* to practice with branches and collaboration, we will work with these further in class next week)
1. Review the notes.
1. Update your KWL chart. Check that all rows are included.
1. Simulate a more computationally intensive program using the `sleep` function in C and compare the time of a threaded vs single threaded version of the program. Include the two programs, output of your test, explanation text, and conclusions in `singlevmultithread.md` (to better illustrate the impact of the threads)
