# How does this all come together?

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["remove-input"]

from IPython.display import Markdown, display

## Logistics and Grading

- I'm a little behind on feedback, will catch up
- [Extra Office Hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_cdqkelouqa82ckeipig58au0es@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
- Zoom link is on slack to keep it private
- To be able to revise, work must be submitted by **May 5 at 4pm**. Feedback will be by afternoon May 6.
- All final work must be submitted by **May 10**  I will do final grading on May 11.


## Contract Checkin


Create an issue on your grading contract repo using the following as a template.

Edit so that it applies to you, including deleting any sections that do not apply to you and assign or tag @brownsarahm on the issue so that I can get to it easily.
```
I am (not) on track to complete my contract as agreed.


I plan to (catch up/ revise my contract / take an incomplete).

To revise my contract I will:
<!-- consultaiton is optional -->
- [ ] attend office hours to discuss options
- [ ] submit the revised contract as PR by the contract revision deadeline of May 2.


To catch up, I will:
- [ ] tag @brownsarahm in all of my open PRs by 5pm today
- [ ] attend office hour on (dates)
- [ ] complete (items) by Thursday at 5pm
- [ ] complete (items) by May 3rd at 5pm
- [ ] complete (items) by May 5 at 4pm
- [ ] complete (items) by May 10

To complete work after accepting an Incomplete grade I will:
- [ ] complete all activities in my contract by (date)

I have the following questions about my grade/grading in this course:

- [ ] q1
- [ ] q2
```


```{important}
The last date to change your contract is May 2
```


```{important}
If you do not complete your contract, you will get an incomplete which will be changed when you complete work or you will get a low grade (eg no work/D/F) at the deadline for me to change the incomplete
```

## Testing Integration manager workflow

See the [prepare for next class](https://introcompsys.github.io/spring2022/notes/2022-04-21.html#prepare-for-next-class) number 1.

<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Why are merge conflicts expected here?


1. Resolve the merge conflicts
1. combine work with your partner on a fork
1. make PR to main sites
1. I will be merging and then tag you when you should resovle the merge conflicton your PR


```{important}
Merge conflicts **will** happen.  Knowing how to fix them is **very** important. I want you to get practice with it.
```

## End of Semester Wrap up

Instead of introducing new big ideas this week, we will reivew and work on tying ideas together.

```{note}
Answers for all of these questions exist in this site
```

What does threading do?

- [ ] divide a program into multiple processes
- [ ] divides a task across multiple computes
- [ ] divide a process into mutlple parts that are completed separately




Why do we need to lock writing to a global variable when threading a program?

- [ ] otherwise all threads will overwrite incorrectly and only the slowest one will be saved
- [ ] otherwise their start/finish order can impact the calculation
- [ ] it is the only way for a variable to be shared across threads



What is git? *multiple may apply**

A. a file system
B. backup software  
C. a version control system
D. a cloud protocol for collaborating on code



Why do we use version control?

- [ ] to have a cloud backup of code
- [ ] it's a legacy tool for undoing changes before IDEs could do it
- [ ] to be able to separate different versions of code




Why floating point instead of fixed point for fractions ?

- [ ] floating point allows for faster calculations
- [ ] floating point allows more precise representation
- [ ] floating point allows for representation of a broader range of values


Label and put in order the following steps of building C code: (replace `x` with a number and `step` with the name of that step)

```

x. **step** binaries for compiled libraries is combined with the compiled program code
x. **step** code is translated from assembly to machine code
x. **step** code from includes is copied into the file
x. **step** code is translated from a high level language to assembly
```

````{margin}
```{note}
The text in () in these sections is an explanation of *why* that task is assigned
```

(class25practice)=
## More Practice

```{important}
- If you're on track, you can skip the following and Thursday's More Practice
- if you are not on track: **today's and Thursdays will count for two each, but will be more complex and integrate concepts across multiple class sessions**

```


```{code-cell} ipython3

display(Markdown(practice))
```


## Questions After Class


### What is the industry standard between github/gitlab/bitbucket? is there one that is better than the other?
```{toggle}
Feature-wise they're relatively comparable, they all do core git and provide hosting.  The details of features are somewhat different.  The deciding factor though, usually comes down to price and/or a moral position on GitHub being owned by Microsoft and having US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a customer.
```
