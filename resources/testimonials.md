# Advice to future students

Don't fall behind on the work, even though all of the work is self-paced you do not want to be doing it all last minute. Also, make sure you re-read the notes after class to get a firmer grasp on what was taught and make sure to always do the `prepare for next class` work so that you won't fall behind in class and you can follow along.
